This paper proposes a new translation-based recommendation model, TUP, and integrates it with a knowledge graph, namely KTUP.
TUP can model various implicit relationships between users and items, which reveals users' preferences for consumer items. 
KTUP further enhances the interpretability of the model by transforming the relationships and permissions, and improves the performance of the two tasks through joint learning.

I think that the idea of using a common learning recommendation system and a knowledge graph completion model in this paper is relatively new. 
Through the translation-based recommendation model and knowledge graph training, it is possible to obtain better recommendation results by inferring the user's preferences in the case of scattered and sparse data, and to provide interpretative recommendations. 
So choose to recommend this paper for learning.
