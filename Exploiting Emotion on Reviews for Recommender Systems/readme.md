In this paper provide a principled and mathematical way to exploit both positive and negative emotion on reviews, and propose a novel framework MIRROR, exploiting eMotIon on Reviews for recommender systems from both global and local perspectives. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and further experiments are conducted to understand how emotion on reviews works for the proposed framework.
